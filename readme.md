# advent of code 2022

this is my repo for my solutions to the 2022 advent of code!

all challenges are written using `typescript` for `deno`.

## running
you should be able to run a day's code with `deno task day-<x>`, where `<x>` is the day you want to run.

use `deno task day-<x>-dev` to auto rerun when saving files.
